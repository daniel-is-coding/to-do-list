# to-do-list


During our UI Master at Nuclio I did the Minor on Fullstack developement. 

We leaarnt and practiced: 

            HTML.
            CSS.
            JavaScript.
            React.
            TypeScript.
            and more...

Here you will find the code repo for some of the lesson I took and practice on a simple app for taking notes and planning personal issues.
